**WARNING: The shortcode can display very private information about your customers (if you decide to). Please use with caution.**

To display the list in the front end, simply use the following shortcode: [customer_list] along with the following attributes and their "true" or "false" value:

* **table_title** : Add a title that will be added at the top of the list. Uses h3 tags that can be styled via css.
* **order_status** : The order status for which the shortcode will display your customers. If you have more than one, seperate them with commas. Options are: wc-completed, wc-processing, wc-on-hold, wc-pending, wc-cancelled, wc-refunded, wc-failed. Default is "wc-completed".
